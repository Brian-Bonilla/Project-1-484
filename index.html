            <p>Hello my name is [Your Name]. 
            I am [Your Age] years old and one of my favorite things to do in my free time is to play soccer.
            I first started liking soccer when I was about 7 years old. I was not a natural talent like Lionel Messi but, I enjoyed playing it.
            My journey started with a lot of mistakes like tripping over the ball and losing the ball way too easily.
            Even though those mistakes were bad, it would always pull me back to try and get better and build confidence to continue playing at my best.
            </p>
            <p>This project is my small story on how this sport made me the person I am today. It helped me connect with family members. 
            Although this is a team game, in rare occasions it turned into a selfish act of wanting to score all the time.</p>
