            <h3>About the Tournament</h3>
            
            <!-- UNIQUE ELEMENT 1: <figure> and <figcaption> -->
            <!-- The <figure> element represents self-contained content with an optional caption -->
            <!-- I'm using it to wrap images with descriptive captions for better semantics -->
            <!-- UNIQUE ATTRIBUTE 1: loading="lazy" -->
            <!-- The loading attribute delays image loading until needed, improving page performance -->
            <!-- I'm using it on all images to speed up initial page load -->

            <!-- UNIQUE ATTRIBUTE 2: datetime (used with <time> element) -->
            <!-- The datetime attribute provides a machine-readable date format -->
            <!-- I'm using it to mark years in a standardized format for search engines and assistive technology -->
            <p>The <time datetime="2026">2026</time> World Cup will be one of the biggest tournaments in soccer history because it has expanded to 48 teams instead of its previous 32. 
                Making it so smaller teams have the ability to compete in this prestigious tournament. This tournament will be hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Making it the first time 3 countries collaborate.
                With more teams added to the roster, it will bring more surprises and maybe a new surprising team to remember like the unforgettable run of Croatia in <time datetime="2018">2018</time>. This tournament is held every four years, in different parts of the world.
                Teams start qualifying 3 years before the main tournament. With every year getting more difficult for each team because of player retirements or changes to the teams. It is exciting because Los Angeles will be hosting some World Cup group stage games.
                The games will be held at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Teams to Watch</h3>
            <p>This upcoming World Cup there are many teams to watch. Each with their own history in this tournament. Brazil, being the team with the most cups won, Argentina coming as defending champions, Spain and their new generation of talented players, Portugal and their underrated team. 
                All these teams have the ability to win the cup but at the end of the day, it is the one who can get the ball behind the goalkeeper and win all games. I am excited to watch all the elite teams but the team I am more excited to watch is Mexico because it is one of my parents' team.
                Even though they have a running curse of losing and being eliminated at the fifth game, this year all the fans hope to continue to the sixth and maybe even the final.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Players to Watch</h3>
            <!-- UNIQUE ELEMENT 2: <mark> -->
            <!-- The <mark> element highlights important text, like using a highlighter -->
            <!-- I'm using it to emphasize key player names and important information -->
            <p>Like stated before, each team has very good players, but some have players that one must watch. For example Spain has young talent like <mark>Lamine Yamal</mark> and <mark>Pedri</mark>. Both of these players playing for Barcelona, they are technical and always ready for a challenge. Another one is Argentina's most loved player, <mark>Lionel Messi</mark>.
                Many speculating this being his last World Cup. In that same boat, <mark>Cristiano Ronaldo</mark> who plays for Portugal, which many see him as the second best player in the world. I am excited to watch all the players because they each have their own unique style of playing.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Why I'm Excited</h3>

            <p>This World Cup is special to me because it is the first time a tournament this big is being held in the city I grew up in. This may be one of the only opportunities to watch a World Cup game so close from home and not from a television. Watching my favorite players and teams compete to win the cup. It also connects my family even more because soccer is our favorite sport to watch and to talk about.
                Being it so close to home, it is probable for me to go to a soccer game and experience the sensation of a game this big and making it a core memory. As stated before, my family and I will be watching each game and hope our favorite team makes it far and win the most prestigious award in soccer history. If it does not happen, there is always the following cup to continue that wish.
