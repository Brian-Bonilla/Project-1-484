            <h2>Growing Up with Soccer</h2>
            
            <h3>How I Started</h3>
            <p>
                I was 7 years old when I started playing the sport I always enjoyed watching and playing.
                I remember being a bad player and having the worst technique in every game I had the chance to play.
                The person that introduced me to soccer was my dad. My dad is a big soccer fan, he first showed me a soccer game and started talking about how it is played and some rules.
                I do not remember the game he was watching at that time but, I do remember that the team he was rooting for won that game.
                After that, I actually started playing with some family members when we would go out to a park. 
                Eventually, I found out my favorite position to play and that made me enjoy it even more.
            </p>
            
            <h3>My Position and Style</h3>
            <p>The position I enjoyed playing was forward.
                Specially a striker. 
                This position is the reason I enjoyed playing soccer growing up. 
                In every soccer game I watched, I would always pay attention to strikers. 
                I paid attention to how they control the ball and how technical they were when they were ready to shoot.
                Once I saw how the professionals played, I try to mimic their techniques. I would do the flashy moves they did but, most of the time they did not come out correctly.
                The euphoria of scoring a goal is amazing, specially if it is an important one like having the deciding goal in a championship match, or a winner takes all game.
                In this position, one should be fast, technical and very physical because the defenders from the opposite team will do anything in their power to try and stop you from scoring that decisive goal.

            <p>In my journey, I had some memorable moments. 
                Some were really good like scoring a goal in a game and some were bad like missing an open goal.
                I will start with the bad memories. 
                The one that still haunts me to this day was the time I <mark>missed an open goal</mark>.
                This was the time I was a freshman in high school, I was in the varsity team and we had to play against one of the teams on top of the leaderboard and a win for us was crucial.
                I was subbed in for the last 30 mins of the game and I had barely had the time to warm up. 
                I was playing very careful for the first couple of minutes, but when I got the hang of it, I started playing well.
                The game was about to end and I got a pass from a teammate, the score was tied <mark>1-1</mark>. At that moment, the only option was to hit the ball once, I had no option of stopping and taking my time.
                I struck the ball but, I did not hit it with direction. I just had the opportunity to hit it and the outcome was hitting the post on a wide open goal. The goalkeeper was nowhere near the goal. When the game ended, my emotions got the best of me. 
                Knowing I had the chance to score and win the game for us, and be the first freshman to score a goal during that season.
                A good memory that I have of this wonderful sport was being able to win a small tournament when I was very young.
                I was in elementary school and it was the final match of the tournament. The winner of the tournament had the prize of a pizza party. 
                I was a striker and this time I scored the winning goal that got our class that pizza party. The goal was the best moment of that game because we won that game <mark>1-0</mark>.

            <h3>What Soccer Taught Me</h3>
            <p>This sport taught me about the highs and the lows. How at one moment you are celebrating a victory and then, at another moment you are trying everything to get your first win in a season of bad performance.
                This sport is about teamwork, where no one can beat a team of 11 by themselves. Each loss pushes you more to taste that victory again. Mistakes are part of the game.
                One has to see how that mistake broke the ecosystem of the team and how the team has to work to fix it. At the end of the day it is about improving, not giving up, and how the team can move forward to the next challenge. 
                Whether the challenge is big or small, it should be tackled smart and precise.
